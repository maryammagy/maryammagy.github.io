I was born in Shiraz, Iran and I came to the United States in 2015 to pursue my graduate studies. I am an immigrant and a member of an underrepresented group in the U.S. and I cannot be thankful enough for the opportunities the U.S. has provided me. Here, I have access to the best scientific resources, conferences, lab facilities which otherwise I could never have. Having these resources while living in the United States and dreaming that one day I will have these resources in the U.S. while living back in my home country have been definitely the most important motivation to do science and one of the most important reasons for the achievements I have had.

However, I am not the only one having that passion and motivation for doing science and exploit the best scientific resources in the United States. There are many people inside and outside of the country who have the same dream and passion as mine. Unfortunately, the significant financial obstacles of college admission and attendance are a barrier to many aspiring scientists. I firmly believe that financial power of a family should not be a factor of who can serve this amazing scientific community in the United States. I hope that universities in the U.S. can work together to make the admissions process more financially inclusive.

classes for 8~18 years old students who were from underrepresented and underprivileged backgrounds. Some of these students were orphans, and many faced challenges such as abuse and neglect in the home. In teaching these students, I found that there were many unique obstacles that limited their ability to thrive in a traditional learning environment. Some pupils fell asleep in class because they had to work till late night to earn some money. I learned to be accommodating of these circumstances, and found ways to engage the students with understanding for their situations. As I worked to build their trust and confidence, I witnessed their intelligence and diligence shining through. I followed up with charity a few years later and I learned that while many students had to cut their education short to work, a couple of them continued in school and they were doing well, which made me the happiest person in the world! As a society, we should make sure that every student has an opportunity to complete their education, regardless of financial status. Education should be a right and not a privilege. This right should extend to all people, and should include accommodations and understanding for those with disabilities or other circumstances that are not always considered in educational settings.

If there is one thing I have learned from my diverse experiences, it is that cooperation and understanding are important factors for success. In my years in academia, I have had the privilege of learning from and working with people from a variety of backgrounds. Richness of personal experience and perspective are indispensable to the realization of any project. As a student, collaborator, and teacher, I have learned that friendly, respectful and supportive teamwork is possible regardless of citizenship, race, sexual orientation, gender, or beliefs. I try to learn and grow every day in my life to be more respectful of others!
