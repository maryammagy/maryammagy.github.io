I was born in [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz), Iran and only after couple of **months**, I looked like these:

I guess now you realized why I wrote months in bold!

My hometown is a warm and dry city so I am not sure what I was thinking when I moved to the U.S. in 2015 to first go to Notre Dame, IN and now New England!

However, living in New England made me connect to the nature and now wherever I go I just look for woods, lakes, and mountains!
