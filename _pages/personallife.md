I was born in [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz), Iran and only after couple of **months**, I looked like these:

</p>
<br/>
I guess now you realized why I wrote months in bold!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My hometown is a warm and dry city so I am not sure what I was thinking when I moved to the U.S. in 2015 to first go to Notre Dame, IN and now New England!

<br/>
<br/>
However, living in New England made me to connect to the nature and now wherever I go I just look for woods, lakes, trails, and mountains!

<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, by living in New England, I have found my favorite hobby and it is hiking!

<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately since 6 months of the year is winter here and I am not that much a winter hiker, I have other hobbies that I do when it is cold outside such as playing foosball (I am good at it), bowling (I thought I am good at it until I played against a pro), drawing (I am not sure about this), and cooking(I am good at it! I believe that)!

Finally, I should mention I do all these activities while I am listening to may favorite singer **Celine Dion** which I can't be happier that I went to her concert in Boston and my dream came true seeing her singing My Heart Will Go On live!
