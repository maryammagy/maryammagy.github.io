My research studies so far can be summarized into two broad areas:
  * Role of reward feedback in cognition and metacognition (real intelligence)
  * Intelligent control system design (artificial intelligence)

**Role of reward feedback in cognition and metacognition (real intelligence)**

During my Ph.D. studies at Dartmouth College, I have been involved in different projects which all have one thing in common: **feedback**! We are interested in understanding how reward feedback interacts with different metacognitive processes such as confidence, and also cognitive processes such as learning, perception or attention.


* **Interaction of reward and confidence in an uncertain environment.** In one of our studies with collaboration with brilliant scientists from UCLA which was published and featured in Editor's highlights in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12725-1), we studied how reward feedback and confidence in choice interact in an environment with uncertainty in both reward and visual information.

**1-minute summary:** Assume that you took a multiple-choice test. For a few questions, you are sure that you know the correct answer and therefore you respond with confidence. When you get the grades back, you realize you were correct in most of those questions. However, you were also wrong is a few of those questions. On the other hand, there are some questions that you had doubt while responding. Some of them turned out to be correct and some wrong. First, how our brains calculate the confidence, so we feel confident in some questions and not in the others? Second, how differently we learn from our mistakes in those questions that we were confident but wrong compared to those questions that we were not that confident and wrong? We studied two different brain regions (ACC and BLA) in rats to find the answer to these questions.

**Long summary:** We knew that subjective sense of certainty, or confidence, in ambiguous sensory cues can alter the interpretation of reward feedback and facilitate learning. However, the interactios between these processes are less known. We trained rats to report the orientation of ambiguous visual stimuli according to a spatial stimulus-response rule that must be learned. Following choice, rats could wait a self-timed delay for reward or initiate a new trial. We found that waiting times increase with discrimination accuracy, demonstrating that this measure can be used as a proxy for confidence. We then used chemogenetic silencing of BLA and ACC to study their roles in calculation of confidence and their roles in learning from reward feedback. We observed that inhibition of BLA shortens waiting times overall whereas ACC inhibition renders waiting times insensitive to confidence, suggesting contribution of ACC but not BLA to confidence computations. We then used a reversal learning task to see how learning is affected by confidence. Both ACC and BLA inhibition blocked the enhancement of learning due to confidence but via differential adjustments in learning strategies and consistent use of learned rules. Altogether, we demonstrated dissociable roles for ACC and BLA in transmitting confidence and learning under uncertainty.

* **Interaction of reward and perception in an uncertain environment.** In a study with help of amazing undergraduate research assistants and interns through [Women is Science Project](https://students.dartmouth.edu/wisp/) which was published in [Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/jocn_a_01516), we studied how reward feedback affects perceptual decision making.

**1-minute summary:** Imagine deciding whether your iPhone or your friendâ€™s Google Pixel takes sharper photos. To make this decision impartially, you look at some photos on both phones but end up favoring your own phone. Your decision could be impartial and entirely based on perceived quality of photos on the two phones but could also be influenced by fun memories of taking photos with your phone. We wanted to see which hypothesis is more probable.

**Long summary:** Perceptual decision-making has been shown to be influenced by reward expected from alternative options or actions, but the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. More specifically, it is debated whether reward effects are mediated through changes in sensory processing, later stages of decision-making, or both. To address this question, we conducted two experiments in which human participants made saccades to what they perceived to be either the first or second of two visually identical but asynchronously presented targets while we manipulated expected reward from correct and incorrect responses on each trial. By comparing reward-induced bias in target selection (i.e., reward bias) during the two experiments, we determined whether reward caused changes in sensory or decision-making processes. We found similar reward biases in the two experiments indicating that reward information mainly influenced later stages of decision-making. Moreover, the observed reward biases were independent of the individual's sensitivity to sensory signals. This suggests that reward effects were determined heuristically via modulation of decision-making processes instead of sensory processing. To further explain our findings and uncover plausible neural mechanisms, we simulated our experiments with a cortical network model and tested alternative mechanisms for how reward could exert its influence. We found that our experimental observations are more compatible with reward-dependent input to the output layer of the decision circuit. Together, our results suggest that, during a temporal judgment task, reward exerts its influence via changing later stages of decision-making (i.e., response bias) rather than early sensory processing (i.e., perceptual bias).
