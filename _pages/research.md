My research studies so far can be summarized in two broad areas:
  * Role of reward feedback in cognition and metacognition (real intelligence)
  * Intelligent control system design (artificial intelligence)

**Role of reward feedback in cognition and metacognition (real intelligence)**

During my Ph.D. studies at Dartmouth College, I have been involved in different projects which all have one thing in common: **feedback**! We are interested to understand how reward feedback interacts with different metacognitive processes such as confidence, and also cognitive processes such as learning, perception or attention.

In one of our studies in rats which was published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12725-1) in 2019 with collaboration of brilliant scientists from UCLA which was later featured on Nature Communications Editor's Highlight, we studied how reward feedback and confidence in choice interact in an environment with uncertainty in both reward and visual information.
