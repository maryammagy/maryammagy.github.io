I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at Dartmouth College. I graduated from University of Notre Dame with a M.S. in Electrical Engineering focusing on Signals, Systems, and Control. I also graduated from Shiraz University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering focusing on Systems and Control.  

I am passionate about Neural prosthetics, Brain-computer interface, Neural Engineering, and Hiking (and only sometimes Running).
