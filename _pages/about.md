I am a Biomedical Engineering Distinguished Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I have a Ph.D. in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience from Dartmouth College. Prior to that, I graduated from University of Notre Dame with a M.S. in Electrical Engineering focusing on Signals, Systems, and Control. I also graduated from Shiraz University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering focusing on Systems and Control.  

I am passionate about Neural Engineering, Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience, Teaching, Cooking, and Hiking (and sometimes Running).
