From the beginning I should say that I **love** teaching! One of the main reasons I like to stay in academia and be a professor is to be able to teach! I have one principle for teaching: ***Try your best to keep the students happy and involved in the class while doing your best that students would finish the term being proud that they have learnt a lot and want to use that knowledge someday in future!*** 
<br/>
Maybe my passion for teaching comes from my experience of having two specifically amazing teachers in the middle school, one in Biology class (Mr. Naghshineh) and the other one in English class (Mr. Tamaddon). Their passion and their knowledge in the subject they were teaching was extraordinary. I learnt so much from them and I am still in touch with them sometimes, even though it is passed almost 16 years. I will always admire them.

I started teaching and tutoring since I was in middle school. I started with tutoring for English course and later for Physics course. Because of my interest in Physics, I was reading most of the course materials for high school even though I was in the middle school. That is why I tutored some high schoolers as well while I was in the middle school.

Later on when I was a Junior and Senior in college, I started teaching Applied Electronics and Digital Circuits in Students' Research and Entrepreneurship centers in Shiraz University and Shiraz Payam Noor University. They were very hands on courses in which students should learn the basics of electronics and circuits and later on actually implement them. While people who are familiar with Electrical Engineering know such a course can be very difficult to do, especially for all the problems that happens while programming AVR and ARM, I was very happy to see students are happy about their experiences. Actually, I am very proud of couple of students in the class who later on became the lecturer for the same course after a few years.
